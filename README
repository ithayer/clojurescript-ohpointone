I'm the most minimal ClojureScript program. 

Run me (I have been shown to work at least with Leiningen 1.7.1)

;; Install my dependencies.

lein deps 

;; Build my ClojureScript.

lein cljsbuild once

;; Start me listening on port 8888.

lein run

;; View my one static page.

http://localhost:8888/index.html

;; Click the button, if all is well, I should show you a popup.


Extend me!
